Development Environments Project
================================


This project was motivated by the need to create and deploy personal development systems using Linux.

The project contains 2 different strategies for provisioning and deploying working systems.  The first set of 
development systems I used used were based upon having locally deployed development systems on Laptops and workstations.
The second deployment strategy shifted to being deployed and hosted within both AWS and DigitalOcean.

The first deployments were done using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and consequently can be found in the Ubuntu-14.04 directory.

The later deployments were done using Ubuntu 16.04 and cab be found in the Ubuntu-16.04 directory.

The motivation behind the move to using DigitalOcean and cloud in general has been the introduction of
two-factor authentication and rock bottom costs for using cloud based offerings.  My development tends
to be using tools such as GoLang, and vim-go going for minimal approachs to solving problems and
so the Ubuntu 16.04 machines being used require only 512 MB of memory, 1 or 2 cores and 20GB of disk for the base OS.
The cost for this system is about $6.00 a month.  Increased storage to 2GB of memory and 40 GB disk system 
is still only $20.00 a month.

The project was begun labour day weekend 2015.

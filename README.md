Developer Bootstrapping Project

This project was motivated by the need to create a personal development environment that has a custom disk layout using a seperate /home partition and a large set of default tools useful for development that are selected based on personal preference.  The projects goal is to provide a developer environment that can be spun up completely, or at least largely automated and in a reproducable manner.

The project was begun labour day weekend 2015
